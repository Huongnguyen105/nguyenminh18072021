Hi, I'm Nguyen Ngoc Bao Minh (but my friends call me Tôm 🦐)!

- Quality management ninja by day, rookie coder by night.
- On a quest to conquer GitHub, one commit at a time.
- Specialist in ISO 9001 and ISO 14001—yes, I keep things organized, even my snacks.
- Life motto: “Work hard, commit harder.”
- Secret talent: Can debug code while drinking coffee and making dad jokes at the same time.
- If you see me pushing weird commits, just know I’m on my way to Level Up! 🚀
Feel free to follow along or drop me a meme!
